FAQ V1.8



Question: 
	Where can i find binaries and/or sources for Unix like OSes ?

Answer: 
	Since version 1.5, this software is now primarily developped for Win32 and is closed sources.
	The reason is i needed a robust plateform for threads
   	At this time, i have not looked at Linux and BSD threads implementation, not yet.
	The old 1.2 release for Windows really needed a complete rewrite and this was another good reason.
   	I still love FreeBSD and Linux though :)
	A port for these systems might be released later but i can't give any date now. 
	Note that sources and binaries for the previous 1.2 version are still downloadable from MDCrack homepage: http://mdcrack.openwall.net.
        Also note that MDCrack has been reported working fine with Wine for Linux (reported by N.Spohrer with release 1.8)
        More information on Wine can be found at http://www.winehq.com/



Question:
	What's new since version 1.2 ?

Answer:
	In summary it now supports parallel cracking as well as load-sharing between up to 8 CPUs.
	This version supports 5 new algorithms and several new optimized cores, is stable and more user friendly.
	For more details please look at the web site: http://mdcrack.openwall.net



Question:	
	Can i redistribute your package on my own site ?

Answer:
	Yes you can but...
	please try to keep the original package structure untouched and provide the same MD5 signature or a link to it. 	
        For those downloading from other sites than http://mdcrack.openwall.net, be sure to check the MD5 checksum on the homepage.		



Question: 
	What algorithm does it support ?

Answer: 
	raw MD2, raw MD4, raw MD5, HMAC-MD4, HMAC-MD5, Microsoft NTLMv1, FreeBSD, Apache, Cisco IOS and PIX (for both Enable and users accounts)
        Invision Power Board 2.x, MD4(MD4(pass)), MD5(MD5(pass)), MD4(MD4(pass).salt), MD5(MD5(pass).salt)
	All algorithms are supported with and without salt.
        As of version 1.7, MDCrack comes with Cis7, a small MDCrack companion tool to handle encoding/decoding of Cisco type 7 passwords.



Question:
	What method of attack does it support ?

Answer:
	Since version 1.5, MDCrack only support bruteforce attacks (also known as incremental) and might never support anything else.
	When passwords are not made of easily guessable names or if they are salted, this program is your best chance.
	For a dictionnary based attack you probably want a program like John the ripper available here: http://www.openwall.com/john 	
	


Question: 
	I have a shadow password file that use FreeBSD MD5 algorithm to store passwords, can i crack them with MDCrack ?

Answer: 
	Yes, MDCrack version 1.7 and greater, comes with two cores that implement FreeBSD MD5 and offers yet another alternative to test your Linux or FreeBSD passwords.



Question: 
	What hash syntax should i use at the commmand line ?

Answer: 
	MD2, MD4, MD5, HMAC-MD4, HMAC-MD5 and NTLMv1 algorithms use the very common asciihex syntax,
        a string made of 32 characters in the following range: [0-9a-fA-F]. 
        123456789abcdef01234567890123456, for example, is a correct hash syntax for these algorithms.
        Note that MDCrack will accept both lowercase and uppercase letters.
        For PIXes algorithms, use a base64 syntax made of 16 characters in the range [0-9a-zA-Z+/]
        This is the very same format found in PIXes configuration.
        srr62dc9/5G1nC)e is a valid example of a PIX hash
        FreeBSD and IOS use the following hash syntax : $1$SALT$HASH
        That is, the same format used in shadow files and IOS configuration files.
        Note that IOS use a salt of 4 bytes while FreeBSD takes 8 bytes
        Apache uses $apr1$SALT$HASH with a salt made of 8 bytes.



Question: 
	Where can i get a valid NTLMv1 hash on my system ?

Answer: 
	In the sam file usually located in "{WINROOT}\system32\config\sam". Use any tool like pwdump2.exe to dump the sam in clear form. 
	The first hash after the username is a Lanmanager hash (weak DES implementation) and the second one is this you want (NTLM).
	Just copy and paste the hash as is (32 characters) in your command line.
	eg: mdcrack --algorithm=NTLM1 6287617255addf63715eefd1b1b0e15f



Question: 
	Where can i get a valid PIX hash, how do i crack it ?

Answer: 
	In your PIX configuration, you should read something like 
	enable password rsg12dl5/1GOnD2e
	copy the last part "rsg12dl5/1GOnD2e" and past it into your command line and use --algorithm=PIX or --algorithm=PIX-E.
	eg. mdcrack --algorithm=PIX rsg12dl5/1GOnD2e

	In the same configuration you may also read one or many lines like:
	username user password dse19dn3/2GOfD2m encrypted privilege 15
	This is a PIX user definition, use a similar command line to crack his hash.
	eg. mdcrack --algorithm=PIX-U --user=user dse19dn3/2GOfD2m
	
        

Question: 
	Every time i try to use PIX algorithms with a salt,
        MDCrack quits after returning a "no suitable core found" message, is it a bug ?

Answer: 
        Actually not, this is a normal behavior since Cisco passwords can't exceed 16 bytes in length.
        By default, MDCrack starts with the assumption that you want to test all possible candidates sizes for the requested algorithm. 
        PIX Cores limit for candidates size being also 16 bytes for PIX algorithms consequently any added salt will go beyond this limit.  
        Simply tell MDCrack you want to test smaller candidates using --maxsize=option.
        --maxsize=10, for instance, will force a Core to stop the session when all candidates made of up to 10 bytes (inclusive) have been tested.
        mdcrack-sse --algorithm=PIX --append=mysalt cfg62ce2/4G2nD5m, will return an error.
        mdcrack-sse --algorithm=PIX --maxsize=11 --append mysalt cfg62ce2/4G2nD5m, will also return an error.
        mdcrack-sse --algorithm=PIX --maxsize=10 --append mysalt cfg62ce2/4G2nD5m won't because maximal possible length won't exceed core limit anymore (10 + 6 in this example).
        Note that it is the exact same thing for PIX user algorithm (--algo=PIX-U)



Question: 
	Do i have a mean to only test one candidate i suspect to be the password ?

Answer:
        Yes use both --count=1 option and --candidate=<your candidate> option.
        First option tells MDCrack to only examine one candidate, second one provides the first candidate to examine.
        Note that even without --count and considering you are not using some other options like --all,
        MDCrack will stop after the first try if your candidate actually collides with the provided hash.
        --count=1 in this example forces it to stop after the first try whatever result occurs.



Question: 
	 My system has two or more processors, what should i do to get advantage of all this processing power ?

Answer: 
	Actually nothing.
        When MDCrack starts it will find all processors that have been detected by your system.
	Default behavior is to work in load sharing mode where the same hash will be processed by all your CPUs.
        MDCrack launchs one worker thread per processor found in your system (each worker thread is a MDCrack Core).
        Work load is first evaluated and then equally shared between each worker.
        So provided that all your processors have correctly been detected by your operating system,
        MDCrack will automatically use all your processing power.   



Question: 
	I have X processors but how do i tell MDCrack to only use X-1 processor(s)?

Answer: 
	Firstly, if your goal is to let enough processing power to other applications you may want to consider using priority option -p.
        Even with a thread running on each one of your processors but at priority IDLE, will let all processors power available for any other
        applications running at higher priorities.
        But if for some other reasons you want to limit the number of threads simply use --threads option.
        Doing so you can, for instance, launch one worker thread at priority HIGH on one processor and keep all processing power of other processors intact.
        This also works at REALTIME priority, but take extra care to really use X-1 processor(s) otherwise you may need to reset your system.



Question: 
	I have X processors but how do i tell MDCrack to use X+1 thread(s)?

Answer: 
	You have no real advantage to do so but you can using option --threads=X+1.
        This option limits overall threads number to 8, but allows you to run up to 8 threads on 1 or more processors if you wish.
        Note that however you will most likely run at a slower speed rate because of implied system context switching operations.  



Question: 
	What is --glue option for ?

Answer: 
	This option uses Windows threads mask affinity feature to force threads to only run on their designated processor
        thus bypassing normal system scheduler rules.
        By default there is no guaranty that X threads will be actually run on X different processors even if it will be the case
        for most situations.
        Because MDCrack threads try to get as much as 100% of your processing power, your system scheduler will most likely
        try to run them on separate processor units.
        But in cases, for instance, where other CPU intensive processes are running at same priority, two or more MDCrack threads may end up running on the same processor.
        This option forces your system to equally distribute threads among processors and you won't find yourself in situation with X threads are sharing the same processor
        while another process is granted the X-1 remaining processors.
        Note if you force X threads (--threads=X option) on you dual processor system, using this option will glue X/2 threads per processor. 


Question: 
	Can i crack more than 1 hash simultaneously like most other password cracker softwares do ?

Answer: 
	yes and no.
        MDCrack will accept only one hash from the command line and all threads will work together, cooperatively, on this very same hash.
        However, you can launch as many MDCrack processes you wish and thus can simultaneously crack several hashes.
        Multi-processors system owners can additionnally reserve a processor for each process worker thread.
        This is however not exactly the same as taking multiple hashes from the same command line.
        Indeed, testing multiple hashes in the same threads allow for greater overall speed than testing them in separate processes.
        This feature will be added in a next release.


Question: 
	What can be done if I already know the charset or password scheme in use in my organisation ?

Answer: 
	You can use the '--charset' option and feed your organisation charset to MDCrack, additionnally you can use the '--mix' option to mix it up randomly before use.
	If you know even partially the password scheme in use (eg: usernameXXXX2006) salts will be of great help, use --prepend=username and --append=2006 in this example.



Question:
	I have no clue about the charset being used by my organisation but i suspect MDCrack default charset ([a-z0-9A-Z]) to be too large or incomplete for my needs.

Answer:
	Either use '--charset' followed by a charset of your choice, or use '--random'=<size> and MDCrack will randomly generate one for you



Question: 
	I feel lucky and seek as many collisions as possible.

Answer: 
	'--all' option will ask MDCrack to not quit after the first collision found, it will actually never quit until you explicitly stop the session
	by using control-C from the console.
	Note that it will also leave if current keyspace has been depleted or if one of the limits has been reached (eg. timer expiration).
	


Question: 
	How fast is MDcrack ?

Answer: 
	As far as i know, MDcrack offers the fastest bruteforce attack for all the algorithms it supports MD2/MD5/MD4/NTLMv1/PIX/PIXu.
	Please let me know if you know anything faster. 



Question:
	MD2 poorly performs in comparison to MD5 on my computer, is it normal behavior ?

Answer:
	Yes, MD2 was designed and optimized for 8 bits architectures, it is hard to optimize on a 32 bits architecture.
	I'm still working on this but do not expect any rate near MD5.



Question: 
	Why prepended salts seem to make MDCrack running slightly slower than with appended salts or no salt at all?

Answer: 
	With no salt or an appended salt MDCrack uses a double-hashing algorithm where two hashes are generated in a row 
	thus benefiting even more from the use of the L1 CPU cache. 



Question: 
	Why are performances so poor with verbosity set (ie. --verbose and --verbose=very) ?

Answer: 
	for obvious reasons, MDCrack makes repetitive calls to IO functions in order to display current candidate and hash.
	This mode should only be considered for fun and educationnal purposes. It should never be used for anything else.
	Since 1.5, you can press any key at the keyboard during a session to get threads runtime statistics.


Question:
	When should i change MDCrack process priority and why ?

Answer:
	In most cases, IDLE is perfect because it will kindly let CPU cycles for any other running applications.
	In some circumstances, a penetration test for instance, you may want to reserve most if not all CPU cycles for MDCrack and use HIGH priority.
	Be aware that REALTIME will make your system unresponding for the whole session time !
	In short, never use --all with --priority=REALTIME ! 
	Otherwise wipe a tear and press reset ;)


Question:
	I am trying to run MDCrack with REALTIME priority but it doesn't work.

Answer:
	You probably don't want to do that but if you know for sure what you are doing, type '--priority=REALTIME' twice at the command line



Question: 
	Can i save my session and resume it at a later time ?

Answer:
	Yes, MDCrack automatically saves your session if you stop it from the console (with control-c). 
	Default session file is located in %USER PROFILE%\Application Data\MDCrack\mdcrack.latest
	To change session filename, use --session=FILENAME from the command line.
	To resume a saved session, either:
		type MDCrack alone 
		or type MDCrack --resume
	The later lets you add more option like '--session' to load an alternate session filename, '--priority' to set process priority etc..
	in fact any option not restored from the session file. 
	
	
Question:
	What are --color[=SCHEME], --fullscreen options used for ?
Answer:
	They are aesthetic options, they affect the screen colors and layout, nothing else
	--color[=SCHEME] switches the console in color mode with an optional color scheme, more readable IMO,
	--fullscreen switches console in fullscreen mode
   

Question: 
	How can i benchmark my system and how to send my results ?

Answer: 
	I still need them, 
	Since version 1.5, type mdcrack --benchmark[=PASS] from the console, wait about the two minutes it takes
	then copy the report and send it to me by email at mdcrack@videotron.ca
	Ideally you should close any other running application, especially applications greedy with your CPU. 
	Before sending your benchmark, check your system has not already been reported in the performance table.
	Also if you see what you think to be an error in this table, please report it by email (mdcrack@videotron.ca)
	Thank you !


Question:
        How does the algorithm auto-detect feature work ? i provided a MD2 hash at the command line but MDCrack is still
        using one of its MD5 cores ?!
        
Answer:
        Well there is no visible difference between a MD5/MD4/MD2 so MDCrack has to default to some algorithm in case of a tie.
        In this case it is MD5.
        Some algorithm specific options like --salt, --username, --nonce will be interpreted as clues to refine the guess but yet there is no way to
        differentiate between a HMAC-MD4 and HMAC-MD5, so if it doesn't default to your algorithm you must provide it using --algorithm option.
        For some other algorithms like FreeBSD, Apache and IOS, the guess is trivial since the hash carries a signature.

Question:
	What is coming in next releases ?
Answer:
	The biggest and most exciting feature under development is Network distribution (i prefer the term 'mass cracking'), still no date to give.
	Meantime, expect to see:
	
	more algorithms and optimized cores. 
	bug fixes
	any new feature you request that makes sense.
